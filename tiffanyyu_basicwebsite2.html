				<h4>Entrepreneurs, Here's Why It's Time to Stop Being so Hard on Yourself</h4>
				<p>I'm a big believer in a multi-passionate life. Most people I know have a side hustle or are working on a passion project. I have a friend here in New York who is a portfolio manager and runs her own nonprofit, and another friend who is on the management team of a nonprofit and cofounded a daily text company for women.</p>

				<p>Running a startup with a full-time job is a great way to explore different passions and entrepreneurship without the risk of being caught in a bind if the startup fails. Given that New York is one of the most expensive places to live, it wouldn't make the most sense for me to bootstrap my startup and live off of savings without a plan in place to have alternative income.</p>

				<p>Of course, trying to manage what two people could do as one person isn't easy. Most importantly, time is money, and with limited time to work on my startup, I might miss out on meetings or opportunities and not be able to cross some time-intensive tasks off of my list for awhile.</p>

				<p>Here are a few ways I've managed to make it work:</p>

				<h5>1. Cut down on your commitments</h5>

				<p>When I decided I was going to launch my startup, I needed to make sure I would be as invested in it as I could be outside of my full-time job. I made a list of all of my commitments (read: everything I spent my time doing-including social media) and started crossing off the ones that weren't the best use of my time. This was energy that could be redirected to building my company. I have always had a hard time saying no, so for everything on my list, I would think, “Does this bring joy to my life or help me propel my startup forward?” If the answer was no, it was time to cut it out.</p>

				<h5>2. Make time for self-care</h5>

				<p>While attending events and meetings plays a role in building my company, I need to make sure I am taking care of myself. As a self-proclaimed introvert, I need time for myself to recharge. That means taking a few nights-and some weekend days-off from the hustle and bustle of the city.</p>

				<h5>3. Celebrate small wins</h5>

				<p>It can be easy to get discouraged when you're sitting at your desk at your full-time job and see one startup become an overnight success and get a ton of press. Instead of making a to-do list, make a “done list.” Write down what you did or accomplished, no matter how small, like hitting send on that email you had been sitting on for days or securing that meeting with a potential partner. At the end of the day, even on the most unproductive of days, you'll see that you made some progress, and that can be a powerful motivator.</p>

				<h5>4. Find your tribe</h5>

				<p>Nothing can be accomplished without collaboration or partnership. When I first started thinking about my company, being a part of Dreamers//Doers helped celebrate my small wins, keep me focused, and supported me in general. It is comforting to be among like-minded people because it's a reminder that I am not alone on this entrepreneurial journey. I am also extremely grateful for the community we have built through my company. Members of our community continue to show up and want to help with social media and marketing. It means a lot and is validating when busy people find value out of what you're creating and want to make the time to help you succeed.</p>

				<h5>5. Be kind to yourself</h5>

				<p>Remember how lucky you are to be able to work and start a company on the side. Not everyone has the means (time and finances) to be able to do something like that. Running a startup with a full-time job is a choice, and it might not be for everyone. If you realize it's not working, listen to your gut. Success takes time. Be patient and don't be so hard on yourself if you're not seeing the results you want right away.</p>

				<h4>4 Ways To Get Excited About Work Again</h4>
				<p>My first job after graduating from college was in investment banking. I still remember the excitement of meeting my fellow analyst class, learning Excel shortcuts, and seeing my first big deal announced. But after a handful of very late nights and missed dinners with friends, it was getting harder for me to find excitement in those little things.</p>

				<p>The feeling is not atypical, and quitting doesn't have to be the only option! Here are a few tips to spark your passion again at work:</p>

				<h5>1. Have informational interviews</h5>
				<p>Maybe it's a student from your alma mater looking to break into the industry or a junior colleague who wants to get to know you better. When someone expresses an interest in you, it is flattering! Talking about the career decisions you made helps you remember your passion, why you decided to pursue this path, and serves as a bit of a pep talk for yourself. Seeing someone want to follow in your footsteps makes you want to serve as a role model and help them get there, too.</p>

				<h5>2. Network</h5>
				<p>Most people say that the best part of their job is the people they work with. By getting to know your co-workers better, you'll feel more engaged in your job because you'll have friends at work. Aside from your colleagues, network with people at your company that you admire. Hearing more about their path and how they got to where they are is inspiring. When you expand your network outside of your peers, your new mentors are invested in your career and success.</p>

				<h5>3. Set goals for yourself</h5>
				<p>Everyone these days is so focused on five and 10-year plans, when it is really those short term goals that help us get there. When was the last time you put together a six-month or one-year list of attainable goals for yourself professionally? The goals can even be some of the tips listed here, like networking with others twice a month, or checking in informally with your manager every three months. When you are focused on attainable goals, you approach every day as one step closer to crossing that goal off your list.</p>

				<h5>4. Ask for more responsibility or work on an extra project</h5>
				<p>Is there someone on your team that you've always wanted the opportunity to work with? Or are you itching to stretch yourself and take on more responsibility?</p>

				<p>New chances to prove yourself are great opportunities to get excited about your job and feel reinforced that your company wants to invest in your career growth.</p>
